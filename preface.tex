This project thesis is submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree MSc. in Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

The motivation has been to study the feasibility of using computer vision offshore, and follow this up with an implementation of a potential application, hopefully aiding in increased safety and reduced cost of operations.

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Tor Onshus from NTNU and co-supervisor Doctor Mads Hvilsh√∏j from MHWirth AS for their guidance and support throughout the project.
