This master thesis is submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree MSc. in Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

The motivation has been to study the feasibility of using computer vision offshore, and follow this up with an implementation of a potential application, hopefully aiding in increased safety and reduced cost of operations.

The motivation for this work has been to implement an automated CCTV system for tracking machines that are in motion, improving upon work previously done in the field. By visually following machines, I hope this work will lead to improved safety and productivity in the industry. Part of this thesis will also look into increasing reliability of control systems that are managing drill pipes on an oil rig.

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Tor Onshus from NTNU and co-supervisor Doctor Mads Hvilsh√∏j from MHWirth AS for their guidance and support throughout the project.
