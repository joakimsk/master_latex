This paper describes the development of machine vision implementations to be used on an offshore oil rig in order to track heavy machinery in motion with the CCTV camera system and verify tubulars stored in a fingerboard. A version of the machine tracking software has been implemented in C++11 which attempts to utilize OpenCL to increase its speed. A proof of concept implementation for detecting tubulars have been implemented in Python. Both cases utilize the OpenCV machine vision library. Based on the findings of the study, the possibility of both heavy machine tracking and tubular detection in fingerboard is verified, but the study is inconclusive on the effect of OpenCL for speedup of machine vision algorithms and further research has to be done. Improvement of the tubular detection implementation is also required.
