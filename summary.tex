Crude oil prices have fallen from \$ 120 to \$ 60 over the last year. Margins are rapidly disappearing, and it is increasingly important for drilling vessels to operate efficiently, safely and quickly.
Meeting the expectations of the market, it is crucial that heavy machine providers can deliver innovative solutions to further reduce costs associated with drilling.

Computer vision is an important technology in the process of automating machinery, yet the weather found offshore is harsh and unforgiving, making it hard to create reliable automated solutions. On the road to full automation, decision support for the operators of machines is important.
This paper evaluates recent technologies for usage in computer vision systems, and takes a look at some possible applications. An actual implementation of an automatic-movement CCTV camera system is also presented, helping the operator as a decision support tool, through the usage of a visually simple glyph.

It is presented a future path to better and more reliable vision systems for the extreme world one may find at sea.
